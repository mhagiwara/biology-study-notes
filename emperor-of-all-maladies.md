# The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer

## Author's Note

## Prologue

* Story of Carla Reed, author's patient with leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells)
* The author recalls his first months during the immersive medical program, and how cancer was such an all-consuming presence in our (including the author's and patients') lives
* The book grew out of the attempt to answer questions: Where are we in the "war" on cancer? Can this war even be won?

* Rudolf Virchow described a case of overgrown white blood cells and called it "white blood" and changed it to "leukemia" in 1847
* hypertrophy ... individual cells grow in size; hyperplasia ... the number grows. cancer = pathological hyperplasia. Virchow called it "neoplasia"
* Common cancer characteristic: uncontrollable pathological cell division
* Leukemia ... a malignant proliferation of white cells in blood
* Chronic leukemia vs acute leukemia (AML and ALL)
* Sidney Farber, born in Buffalo in 1903, became a full-time pathologist at Children's Hospital in Boston
* Leukemia possessed a singularly attractive feature: it could be measured. Intervention can be evaluated in living patients
