# The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer

## Author's Note

* "This book is a history of cancer."
* The author completed a residency in medicine and graduate work in cancer immunology
* Two characters—Sidney Farber, "the father of modern chemotherapy," and Mary Lasker, a health activist and philanthropist who joined Farber in his journey

## Prologue

* Story of Carla Reed, author's patient with leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells)
* The author recalls his first months during the immersive medical program, and how cancer was such an all-consuming presence in our (including the author's and patients') lives
* The book grew out of the attempt to answer questions: Where are we in the "war" on cancer? Can this war even be won?
* Cancer is a disease caused by the uncontrolled growth of a single cell
* Treating: prevent these mutations, or eliminate the mutated cells
* Cancer is related to age—mutations in cancer genes accumulate with aging
* Author giving Carla her diagnosis (acute lymphoblastic leukemia)

## Chapter 1. "A Suppuration of blood"

* In 1845, John Bennett described a leukemia case "A Suppuration of blood"
* Rudolf Virchow described a case of overgrown white blood cells and called it "white blood" and changed it to "leukemia" in 1847
* hypertrophy ... individual cells grow in size; hyperplasia ... the number grows. cancer = pathological hyperplasia. Virchow called it "neoplasia"
* Common cancer characteristic: uncontrollable pathological cell division
* Leukemia ... a malignant proliferation of white cells in blood
* Chronic leukemia vs acute leukemia (AML and ALL)
* Sidney Farber, born in Buffalo in 1903, became a full-time pathologist at Children's Hospital in Boston
* Leukemia possessed a singularly attractive feature: it could be measured. Intervention can be evaluated in living patients

## Chapter 2. "A monster more insatiable than the guillotine"

* The number of hospitals and patients increased dramatically between 1940 and 1960, "victories of postwar medicine" helped, but cancer (the nation's second most common killer by 1926) still remained a black box
* To cure cancer, doctor only had two options—surgery or radiation
* In 1937, National Cancer Institute (NCI) was created after President Roosevelt signed an act
* Anemia in Bombay was caused by lack of folic acid/folate—Farber wondered if administering folic acid can cure leukemia, which didn't work
* Yalla Subbarao synthesizes folic acid from scratch, making variants (or "antifolate"), which Farber obtained

## Chapter 3. "Farber's Gauntlet"

* Farber used one of Yalla's "antifolate" to an ALL child (Sandler), which led to temporary remission

## Chapter 4. A Private Plague

* Cancer is an expansionist disease—it expands and invades
* Cancer is an evolving disease
* Author felt he was writing not about something, but about someone, thus "biography"
* Earliest potential mention of cancer in a papyrus from Egypt, describing "a bulging mass in the breast"
* Greek historian Herodotus records the story of Atossa, with a bleeding lump in her breast
* First evidence of cancer (a malignant bone tumor) found in a mummy dug from the Chiribaya site
* "There is very little early history of cancer"
* People didn't live long enough to get cancer before civilization—civilization didn't cause cancer, but it "unveiled" it
* Our capacity for detecting cancer, and attributing deaths to it, improved too

## Chapter 5. Onkos
* "Cancer" comes from karkinos, the Greek word for "crab." (from the shape of superficial tumors)
* Onkos was the Greek term for a burden
* Claudius Galen (a Greek writer/doctor) thought cancer was trapped black bile (out of four types of fluids, or "humors"). Removal of tumors was perceived as a fool's operation

## Chapter 6. Vanishing Humors
* Andreas Vesalius, scouring the graveywards in Paris for bodies for anatomy, couldn't find Galen's black bile
