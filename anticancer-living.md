## Preface

* Diet and exercise are important, but managing stress and managing healthy sleep habits are crucial

## Introduction

* Inspired by David Servan-Schreiber "Anticancer: A New Way of Life" 
* Cancer develops within an environment created by what we eat, stress, physical activity, support network, sleep, and environmental toxins

## 1. The Anticancer Revolution

* Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. More people are living longer with cancer
* Our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever
* Over the fifty years, 10-year survival rate doubled (1/4 to 1/2)
* Not smoking, drinking in moderation, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly could prevent 2/3 of cases and deaths in men
* “Attitude clearly matters in fighting cancer. We don’t know why . . . but most people with the same cancer for age, class, health, socioeconomic status, and, in general, those with positive attitudes, with a strong will and purpose for living, a commitment to struggle, with an active response to aiding their own treatment and not just a passive acceptance of anything doctors say, tend to live longer.”

## 2. Our Healing Powers

* Brazil nuts have high levels of selenium, a trace mineral that has been shown to reduce prostate cancer risk
* The more cancer prevention guidelines someone follows, the greater the reduction in cancer risk and cancer-related death
* Nothing feeds cancer like a sense of hopefulness—oncologists sense that mental outlook and emotional well-being are key to cancer survival
* Study: people who had strong emotional support survived significantly longer after surgery compared to woman who reported less support

## 3. What Causes Cancer, Anyway?

* Only 5-10% of all cancers are caused by inherited genetic mutations
* Quitting smoking at the time of diagnosis improves the survival drastically (29 -> 63%)

## 4. A Cell's Quest for Immortality

* One of cancer's enabling characteristics: tumor-promoting inflammation

## 5. The Epigenetics of Prevention

* Stress and epigenetics—people in poverty have changes in gene expression that make them more susceptible to developing cancers. Those effects are reversible
* Evolutionary analysis of metastasis—metastasis paths show "branchlike" patterns, which even occurs before a primary tumor is diagnosed. Metastasis is driven by "driver mutations"

## 6. Synergy and the Mix of Six

* diet, environment (toxins), exercise, stress + social support, sleep
* The benefit of each lifestyle factor is enhanced and heightened when we make changes in more than one area
* Raising the kids the anticancer way—do by examples. 
* Glenn Sabin's recovery from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with only natural methods (documented in his book "n of 1")

## 7. The Foundation is Love and Social Support

* Giving our time to support others may improve our body's ability to prevent and overcome disease—volunteer work reduced early mortality rate by 22 percent.
* "Early interventions targeting cancer survivors' social networks could improve quality of life during survivorship"
* Research shows that when we stay connected to those who love and those who want to help us, cancer is less likely to progress, lives are extended, and overall health improves
* A 2017 study of women with breast cancer found that those with the most social ties were less likely to die from cancer
* Those who were married had a 20 percent better chance of surviving than those who were either single, divorced, or widowed
* Stronger social support -> reduced levels of the cancer hallmarks of: sustaining proliferative signaling, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, avoiding immune destruction, and tumor-promoting inflammation.
* People who have a purpose in life tend to be happier and healthier than their counterparts who are less purpose driven
* Performing acts of kindness for others activates gene profiles reflective of reductions in inflammation and increase in antibody responses
* What are my core values? Always learn, always open to diversity, always be different
* Volunteering on a regular basis reduced early mortality rates by 22 percent

## 8. Stress and Resilience
* Chronic stress is associated with worse outcomes for those with cancer—stress dysregulates the immune system, and releases hormones that grow cancer
* David Servan-Schreiber: “One of the best defenses against cancer is finding a place of inner calm.”
* Jon Kabat-Zinn developed mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
* Their research showed those who had been through MBSR had an enhanced immune response in a dose-response manner
* Research found that meditation reduces inflammation and the experience of pain
* there is a growing body of research that does link chronic stress with cancer tumor growth and with cancer proliferation.
* Gratitude lowers stress hormone and inflammation
* Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) fared over the longer term
* Meditation has been shown to lesson the side effects of chemo, lower cortisol levels, and reduce inflammation.

## 9. The Need for Rest and Recovery

* When we aren't well-rested, there are negative effects on key cancer hallmarks, including increased inflammation and decreased immune function, leading to tumor growth. 
* Dysregulated cortisol rhythm is linked with increased mortality in many cancers, including lung.
* Some scientists classify long-term shift work as a "probable" carcinogen
* Michael Phelps sleeps 8h + 2-3h per day. So does Usain Bolt
* More than 90% of all American high school students are sleep deprived
* "Oversleepers" are not enjoying quality sleep, raising their risk of developing heard disease, obesity, depression, and chronic illnesses
* Poor sleep has been linked to increased cancer risk and poorer outcomes for cancer survivors
* Sleeping pills do not tackle the root problem leading to sleep disturbances. Pill-assisted sleep is not truly restorative sleep
* Methods for improving sleep: CBT-I, Tai Chi, meditation, Yoga
* Light therapy (being exposed to bright light for thirty minutes every morning) is effective for cancer-related fatigue for patients going through chemotherapy

## 10. Moving for Wellness

* Physical inactivity is as detrimental as smoking or eating poorly
* Benefits: reduce stress, promote mental health, sleep better, reduce obesity
* Spend time outside— shinrin-yoku has not just mood but also has physiological responses.
* Among prostate cancer patients, men who were the most active reduced their mortality by 40%. Breast cancer survivors who exercised at a moderate level had 50% reduction of recurrence.
* Resting makes the side effects of cancer treatments worse. Best treatment for fatigue was physical activity, better than any pharmacological treatment
* Patients who exercised during chemo or radiation: more likely to receive all treatments, fewer side effects, improved QoL
* Our bodies are not made for extended periods of sitting. colon cancer patients who sat more than six hours -> 30% more mortality, even after controlling for physical activity
* Exercise counteracts aging caused by chemotherapy
* Exercise impacts ALL the cancer hallmarks, especially, sustaining proliferative signaling, metabolism, immune function, and inflammation
* Walking is as effective as other exercises re reducing inflammation and protecting against chemo cognitive side effects
* exercise better than medications re: reducing fatigue
* yoga and tai chi are effective
* Simply sitting less and moving more is better than exercising an hour a day if you sedentary for fourteen hours
* Break up your sitting time hourly (by sitting up)
* Stand up periodically on long flights
