## Preface

* Diet and exercise are important, but managing stress and managing healthy sleep habits are crucial

## Introduction

* Inspired by David Servan-Schreiber "Anticancer: A New Way of Life" 
* Cancer develops within an environment created by what we eat, stress, physical activity, support network, sleep, and environmental toxins

## 1. The Anticancer Revolution

* Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. More people are living longer with cancer
* Our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever
* Over the fifty years, 10-year survival rate doubled (1/4 to 1/2)
