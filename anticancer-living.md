## Preface

* Diet and exercise are important, but managing stress and managing healthy sleep habits are crucial

## Introduction

* Inspired by David Servan-Schreiber "Anticancer: A New Way of Life" 
* Cancer develops within an environment created by what we eat, stress, physical activity, support network, sleep, and environmental toxins

## 1. The Anticancer Revolution

* Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. More people are living longer with cancer
* Our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever
* Over the fifty years, 10-year survival rate doubled (1/4 to 1/2)
* Not smoking, drinking in moderation, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly could prevent 2/3 of cases and deaths in men
* “Attitude clearly matters in fighting cancer. We don’t know why . . . but most people with the same cancer for age, class, health, socioeconomic status, and, in general, those with positive attitudes, with a strong will and purpose for living, a commitment to struggle, with an active response to aiding their own treatment and not just a passive acceptance of anything doctors say, tend to live longer.”

## 2. Our Healing Powers

* Brazil nuts have high levels of selenium, a trace mineral that has been shown to reduce prostate cancer risk
* The more cancer prevention guidelines someone follows, the greater the reduction in cancer risk and cancer-related death
* Nothing feeds cancer like a sense of hopefulness—oncologists sense that mental outlook and emotional well-being are key to cancer survival
* Study: people who had strong emotional support survived significantly longer after surgery compared to woman who reported less support

## 3. What Causes Cancer, Anyway?

* Only 5-10% of all cancers are caused by inherited genetic mutations
