## Preface

* Diet and exercise are important, but managing stress and managing healthy sleep habits are crucial

## Introduction

* Inspired by David Servan-Schreiber "Anticancer: A New Way of Life" 
* Cancer develops within an environment created by what we eat, stress, physical activity, support network, sleep, and environmental toxins

## 1. The Anticancer Revolution

* Cancer is now, for many, considered a serious, chronic disease. More people are living longer with cancer
* Our success rate at keeping people alive after a cancer diagnosis is better than ever
* Over the fifty years, 10-year survival rate doubled (1/4 to 1/2)
* Not smoking, drinking in moderation, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly could prevent 2/3 of cases and deaths in men
* “Attitude clearly matters in fighting cancer. We don’t know why . . . but most people with the same cancer for age, class, health, socioeconomic status, and, in general, those with positive attitudes, with a strong will and purpose for living, a commitment to struggle, with an active response to aiding their own treatment and not just a passive acceptance of anything doctors say, tend to live longer.”

## 2. Our Healing Powers

* Brazil nuts have high levels of selenium, a trace mineral that has been shown to reduce prostate cancer risk
* The more cancer prevention guidelines someone follows, the greater the reduction in cancer risk and cancer-related death
* Nothing feeds cancer like a sense of hopefulness—oncologists sense that mental outlook and emotional well-being are key to cancer survival
* Study: people who had strong emotional support survived significantly longer after surgery compared to woman who reported less support

## 3. What Causes Cancer, Anyway?

* Only 5-10% of all cancers are caused by inherited genetic mutations
* Quitting smoking at the time of diagnosis improves the survival drastically (29 -> 63%)

## 4. A Cell's Quest for Immortality

* One of cancer's enabling characteristics: tumor-promoting inflammation

## 5. The Epigenetics of Prevention

* Stress and epigenetics—people in poverty have changes in gene expression that make them more susceptible to developing cancers. Those effects are reversible
* Evolutionary analysis of metastasis—metastasis paths show "branchlike" patterns, which even occurs before a primary tumor is diagnosed. Metastasis is driven by "driver mutations"

## 6. Synergy and the Mix of Six

* diet, environment (toxins), exercise, stress + social support, sleep
* The benefit of each lifestyle factor is enhanced and heightened when we make changes in more than one area
* Raising the kids the anticancer way—do by examples. 
* Glenn Sabin's recovery from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with only natural methods (documented in his book "n of 1")

## 7. The Foundation is Love and Social Support

* Giving our time to support others may improve our body's ability to prevent and overcome disease—volunteer work reduced early mortality rate by 22 percent.
* "Early interventions targeting cancer survivors' social networks could improve quality of life during survivorship"
* Research shows that when we stay connected to those who love and those who want to help us, cancer is less likely to progress, lives are extended, and overall health improves
