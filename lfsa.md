* One estimate: 30% of cancers are caused by diet
* Clear correlation between animal fat and breast cancer mortality (not genetic, after following Japanese immigrants to the US)
* Fat intake vs brest cancer risk: statistically significant in case-control but not in prospective studies
* Food diary is more accurate than FFQ (food frequency questionnaires)
* Conclusion: no important association between fat intake and breast cancer risk
* Randomized trial on fat intake: intervention didn't prove beneficial
* Total fat intake -> type of fat is more important
* Fruit and vegetable intake didn't show correlation w/ cancer risk (vs cardiovascular disease)
* Vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risk for ER-negative patients, same for beta-carotene
* Berries and peaches/nectarines reduce relative risk of breast cancer for ER- patients
* Higher BMI is related to risks for all cancers
* Folate intake (vegetables) decreases the risk of colorectal cancer
* Alcohol consumption clearly increases the risk of brest cancer (just 5 gram per day)
* Milk and fatal prostate cancer (positive)
* Animal fat and breast cancer (positive)
* Vegetable fat and prostate cancer survival (positive)
* Exercise reduces breast and colorectal cancer, avoid overweight
