## What to Do if Resistance Develops? - 01-16-24 - Lung Cancer Living Room™
https://vimeo.com/showcase/8628314/video/913571176

* what is resistance?
    * at some point cancer stops responding to the treatment
    * can acquire second mutation
    * no ways to predict, very heterogeneous
* "no one cancer is alike"
* the best way to find resistance — do scans regularly at an early stage
* catch it early, treat it early before it spreads
* what should patients should look out for?
    * symptoms (pain, breathing, coughs)
    * reach out to the doctor
* "All you have to do is live long enough to get the next best thing."
* PET scans can have false positives (things light up)
* Chemoradiation (mostly for stage III)
* if only one or two sites are developing resistance, we can just radiate them and continue the same treatment, that's why catching early is important
* blood-brain barrier, chemotherapy can't pass
* new treatment: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) - chemotherapy + antibody (=targeted chemotherapy) e.g., Trop2, DLL3. Needs Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
* don't be afraid of chemotherapy, today's chemo made lots of progress—Pemetrexed (Alimta) - wasn't around 20 years ago, much better tolerated. we also have better drugs to prevent/manage side effects
* lots of trials looking at mutation, but the number of limited to each subgroup. small window where patients need to find a new treatment

* chemotherapy and how it has changed in the last 50 years
    * medications that treat nausea and other side effects are significantly better
    * chemo drugs don't necessarily cause hair loss
    * "Chemo is better tolerated these days than it was twenty years ago because of the supportive medications we have right now."
    * targeted therapies + chemo
* how has radiation therapy evolved
    * can target very specifically
    * brain metastasis minimize damage to normal tissues
    * Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
* targeted therapy
    * first drug in 2009 for EGFR
    * now have KRAS and HER2
* immunotherapy
    * great for subset of people, but not for others, just like targeted therapy
    * genomic alterations, PD-L1
    * some people "cured" this incurable disease
* sclc
* early detection
* surgery
* you don't get placebo during clinical trials—they usually compare the best option and the tested options
* early screening

* New therapies approved within the last 5 years more than 5 decades
* Biomarker testing is important, lung cancer is very heterogenous disease
* NSCLC vs SCLC -> molecular profile
* markers for immune system and immune function
* For squamous (扁平上皮) cancer (more for smokers) and SCLC, immunotherapy is becoming a mainstay
* Comprehensive vs single-gene testing. 7-8 genes
* Now we have drugs for KRAS
* Liquid biopsy for tumors that are hard to do biopsy
* When tumors regrow, do biopsy
* EGFR registers https://egfrcancer.org/
* osimertinib less toxicity, more penetration into brain, doing trial
* chemotherapy
* cisplatin/carboplatin with radiation can kill cancer tumors
* So many supportive care for side effects
* Adjuvant therapy
* Immunotherapy — some patients doing well from 2010 Squ cancer
* Works only 10-15% of patients (e.g., PDL1)
* Tumor boards, team get together and discuss treatment
* Palliative care - bring early and improves survival
