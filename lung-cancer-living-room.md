* what is resistance?
    * at some point cancer stops responding to the treatment
    * can acquire second mutation
    * no ways to predict, very heterogeneous
* "no one cancer is alike"
* the best way to find resistance — do scans regularly at an early stage
* catch it early, treat it early before it spreads
* what should patients should look out for?
    * symptoms (pain, breathing, coughs)
    * reach out to the doctor
* "All you have to do is live long enough to get the next best thing."
* PET scans can have false positives (things light up)
* Chemoradiation (mostly for stage III)
* if only one or two sites are developing resistance, we can just radiate them and continue the same treatment, that's why catching early is important
* blood-brain barrier, chemotherapy can't pass
* new treatment: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) - chemotherapy + antibody (=targeted chemotherapy) e.g., Trop2, DLL3. Needs Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
* don't be afraid of chemotherapy, today's chemo made lots of progress—Pemetrexed (Alimta) - wasn't around 20 years ago, much better tolerated. we also have better drugs to prevent/manage side effects
* lots of trials looking at mutation, but the number of limited to each subgroup. small window where patients need to find a new treatment
