# The Sounds of Life

## Introduction

* Humans are a poor listener (no infrasonic, no ultrasonic)
* Plants emit ultrasonic noises, sweetened nectar
* Progress on digital recording devices
* "Many species have richer, more complex communication and social behaviors than previously understood

## Sounds of Life

* Herbert L. Aldrich discovered whale music
* Navy's interested in the deep sound (SOFAR) channel for sound surveillance
* William Watkins with Bill Schevill traveled ocean, recorded whale sounds and published
* Sperm whale are the loudest animal on earth (200 decibels)
* Katy and Roger Payne's whale "music", publishing "Songs of the Humpback Whale"

## The Singing Ocean

* Chris Clark on a whale recording expedition, working with Iñupiat (Alaska natives)
* There were many more whales than Western scientists and IWC had realized
* Shiu et al., 2020 Deep neural networks for automated detection of marine mammal species
 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57549-y
* digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) equipped with hydrophone, accelerometer, magnetometer, provide valuable insights

## Quiet Thunder

* Elephant poaching in Africa (Kenya)
* Katy Payne recoding elephant infrasounds (conversation through the wall)
* Joyce Pool started working on elephants' vocal and social behaviors, launched the Elephant Listening Project in the African rainforest, using ARUs (autonomous recording units)
* They pivoted to use bioacoustics to prevent poaching, using source separation technique ("Deep Karaoke")
* For farmer-elephant conflict, Lucy King started the Human-Elephant Coexistence Program, using African honeybees to defer them. Elephants have a specific word for "honeybee"
* Joyce Pool et al.'s the Elephant Ethogram (list of behaviors)
* Payne's discoveries reveal a deeply human bias towards infrasonic and existence of elephant communication

## Voice of the Turtle

* Camila Ferrara working on the first systematic scientific study of turtle sounds—experts were skeptical at first that turtles making any noise
* "Not only did the turtles make noise, they made lots of it, day and night."
* Turtles use an underwater communication system with a repertoire of complex sounds
