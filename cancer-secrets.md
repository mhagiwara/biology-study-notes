# Cancer Secretes (Second Edition)

* A strong support system for cancer patients is important ... has been shown to improve treatment outcomes.
* Cancer scientific evidence is mostly based on large-scale RCTs, but few fund those studies for e.g. off-label use of existing medications, supplements, nutritional interventions etc.
* Author is open minded for small-scale studies with promising results
* Fighting cancer exclusively with natural remedies based on unscientific information rarely end wellâ€”we need to include both conventional and so called "alternative" therapies
* Second edition added new research and therapies

## Chapter 1. Where We Are, and How We Got Here

* History of cancer
    * Scottish surgeon John Hunter suggested cancers might be cured by surgery.
    * German pathologist Johannes Muller determined cancer was made up of cells, Rudolf Virchow advancing the cellular pathology of cancer
    * Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X-ray. Daily doses of radiation improved cancer patients' survival, but radiation also causes cancer
    * In 1971, President Nixon declared "war on cancer," established NCI (National Cancer Institute)
    * Lifetime risk of developing cancer has been on the rise
* Standard care
    * Surgery is still the first line of defense, although it is typically used with other therapies due to the fact that cancer metastasizes
    * Chemotherapy was born when the US military was studying mustard gas weapons and discovered they are effective in fighting lymphoma
    * Immunotherapy seeks to boost the body's natural cancer-fighting mechanisms. Many drugs naturally occur in the body (e.g., interferons, interleukins, and other cytokins)
* Cancer today
    * The largest missing piece of cancer today is about prevention
    * A 2002 concluded 1/4 to 1/3 of cancers could be prevented with exercise and weight control. A 2016 study found maintaining a healthy weight and regular, weekly exercise reduced cancer risk by 40%. Lifestyle modification could prevent nearly half of all cancer deaths.
    * Second problem is the lack of cancer screening
    * Only 6-8% of cancers are caused by genetics
* Cost of cancer
    * Part of high costs of cancer care are due to high prices of cancer drugs (high R&D costs)
    * Insurance rates skyrocket for the past few decades, and healthcare providers have little incentive to keep costs down when insurance covers much of the care
    * Private sector doesn't not benefit from natural interventions (diet, vitamins, other alternative therapies)
