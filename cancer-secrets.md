# Cancer Secretes (Second Edition)

* A strong support system for cancer patients is important ... has been shown to improve treatment outcomes.
* Cancer scientific evidence is mostly based on large-scale RCTs, but few fund those studies for e.g. off-label use of existing medications, supplements, nutritional interventions etc.
* Author is open minded for small-scale studies with promising results
* Fighting cancer exclusively with natural remedies based on unscientific information rarely end well—we need to include both conventional and so called "alternative" therapies
* Second edition added new research and therapies

## Chapter 1. Where We Are, and How We Got Here

* History of cancer
    * Scottish surgeon John Hunter suggested cancers might be cured by surgery.
    * German pathologist Johannes Muller determined cancer was made up of cells, Rudolf Virchow advancing the cellular pathology of cancer
    * Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X-ray. Daily doses of radiation improved cancer patients' survival, but radiation also causes cancer
    * In 1971, President Nixon declared "war on cancer," established NCI (National Cancer Institute)
    * Lifetime risk of developing cancer has been on the rise
* Standard care
    * Surgery is still the first line of defense, although it is typically used with other therapies due to the fact that cancer metastasizes
    * Chemotherapy was born when the US military was studying mustard gas weapons and discovered they are effective in fighting lymphoma
    * Immunotherapy seeks to boost the body's natural cancer-fighting mechanisms. Many drugs naturally occur in the body (e.g., interferons, interleukins, and other cytokins)
* Cancer today
    * The largest missing piece of cancer today is about prevention
    * A 2002 concluded 1/4 to 1/3 of cancers could be prevented with exercise and weight control. A 2016 study found maintaining a healthy weight and regular, weekly exercise reduced cancer risk by 40%. Lifestyle modification could prevent nearly half of all cancer deaths.
    * Second problem is the lack of cancer screening
    * Only 6-8% of cancers are caused by genetics
* Cost of cancer
    * Part of high costs of cancer care are due to high prices of cancer drugs (high R&D costs)
    * Insurance rates skyrocket for the past few decades, and healthcare providers have little incentive to keep costs down when insurance covers much of the care
    * Private sector doesn't not benefit from natural interventions (diet, vitamins, other alternative therapies)
* Natural medicine is a double-edged sword—a wealth of information exists online but many patients are not scientifically literate and easy to fall into mis-information. Exclusively relying on natural therapies typically ends very poorly

## Chapter 2. What is cancer?

* Hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinburg, 2000)
    * Has self-sufficient growth signals
    * Is insensitive to anti-growth signals
    * Evades apoptosis
    * Has limitless replicative potential
    * Possesses sustained angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels)
    * Spreads to distant sites (metastasis)
* "Strong immune system is the best defense against cancer" is a misconception. The immune system recognizes no distinction between a cancer cell and a normal cell
* More focus on genetics, less focus on the causes of mutations and prevention
* Environment factors
    * Glyphosate (pesticide) is classified as Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans), although it has been widely used for corn and soy
    * Many chemicals remain untested for cacinogenicity
    * Dr Ryke Hamer found that traumatic life events set biochemical changes that could lead to cancer
* Cancer as a metabolic disease
    * Dr Otto Warburg received the Novel Prize for discovering the way cancer cells make energy
    * Cancer cells burn sugar only energy and only produce 2 units of ATP (vs 32-36 units of normal cells)
    * Dr Sayfried believes many hallmarks of cancer are all downstream of the primary issue—the interference of metabolism
* Epigenetics—expression of certain genes is contingent upon a host of external factors

## Chapter 3. What is integrative oncology?

* Integrative oncology combines conventional medicine and alternative medicine, and offers a wider palette of therapies and treatments
* Many patients receive "first-line" treatment, and then second-line treatment etc, i.e., one-size-fits-all approach
* Oncologists don't tell you about nutrition, supplementation, exercise, stress reduction, natural or alternative therapies
* Typical advice: "it does not matter what you eat, as long as you don't loose weight" -> not based on evidence!
* Information given by nutritionist is very basic and poor
* Integrative oncology embraces standard tools such as radiation and surgery
* Integrative oncology treats cancer as a metabolic disease
    * Cancer uses glucose, so a ketogenic diet can kill it? No, cancer will use other macronutrients, such as protein, fact etc.

## Chapter 4. Diagnosis

* CBC with differential (immune system cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin etc.)
* Comprehensive metabolic panel (blood glucose, kidney/liver health, electrolytes)
    * Albumin level is an important status marker (optimal is at least 4 g/dL)
* C-Reactive Protein (CPR) measures cellular inflammation
* Hemoglobin A1c (for diagnosing diabetes, blood sugar control), the lower the better for cancer (5.2% or less)
* Vitamin B12 - High B12 levels are associated with higher chance of cancer, be cautious about supplementation
* Vitamin D - Very important lab to measure, important for immune systems. Target=50-80 ng/mL when dealing with cancer
* MRI is radiation-free and can take detailed images, but they are expensive and can be denied by insurance in favor of cheater options (CT scans)
* PET scan uses contrast agents (radio-labeled glucose) to distinguish cancerous tumors. Can be expensive and insurance can deny coverage

## Chapter 5. Treatments in Integrative Oncology

* Chemotherapy is usually based on MTD (maximum tolerated dose). Integrative oncology uses fractionated chemotherapy (10-20% of MTD) with higher frequency
* Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT): use insulin to make "dormant" cells susceptible to chemotherapy. Fasting 10-14 hours leading to chemo helps create an anti-cancer environment
* Off-label use of pharmaceuticals
    * Metformin (type 2 diabetes drug): diabetics who tke metformin have 54% lower risk of cancer. also kills cancer stem cells
    * Aspirin: aspirin takers lower incidence of cancer. Low dose aspirin can increase survival by up to 20% and reduce metastases
    * Propanolol (high blood pressure): stress plays a role (it spreads) in cancer
    * Statins (lower cholesterol): positive effects on prevention and survival
* Intravenous Vitamin C: "it does not have the profound anti-cancer effect we had hoped"
* Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF)

## Chapter 6. The Role of Nutrition in Cancer Prevention and Treatment

* 40-50% cancer cases could be prevented with lifestyle changes, and dietary changes are a significant portion
* Conventional oncology: "it doesn't matter what you eat, so long as you do not lose too much weight" is wrong
* Using diet alone as a treatment is ineffective
* Food additives and contaminants to avoid
    * sodium nitrite: used in cured and processed meat such as bacon and sausages. Leads to gastric cancers
    * rBGH: bovine growth hormone. Could lead to increased level of IGF-1 which can promote tumors. Banned in Europe and Canada but not in the US
* Tips on how to make your food safer
    * Avoid processed food
    * Avoid cured meats
    * Eat organic whenever possible
    * Eating out must become more of an occasional occurrence, rather than a regular practice
* Nutrition is important, but you don't have to be perfect. 80/20 or 90/10 approaches work
* Vegetables—cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli are rich in sulfuric compounds which have notable anti-cancer actions. Eat vegetables of various colors
* Fruits—fructose effect is alleviated by fiber. Berries, apples, tomatoes, grapes, pineapples, and citrus fruits provide strong anti-cancer benefits
* Eat raw: broccoli, cabbage, garlic and onions
* Eat cooked: tomatoes, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms, spinach
* Beans can lead to a lower risk of developing cancer. Eat canned food sparingly
* Grains—gluten lead to a higher risk of cancer for those who are allergic to it. Sprouted grains (e.g., Ezekiel 4:9) have higher fiber content, vitamins and minerals, and are easier to digest
* Attempting to starve cancer by depriving just one macro-nutrient wouldn't work
* Include healthy fats as an essential component of an anti-cancer diet. A great way to maintain weight
* Herbs and spices: garlic, turmeric, oregano, black cumin, saffron, black pepper, and chilli pepper are anti-cancer superstarts
* Dr Stegall's Seven Superfoods: garlic, broccoli, carrots, beets, ginger, tomatoes, and cranberries
* Smoothie (mixing) is better than juicing because of fiber
